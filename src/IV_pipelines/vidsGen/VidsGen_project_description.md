VidsGen: AI Longer Form Video & Music Generation Pipeline

Project Overview

VidsGen is an AI-driven long-form video and music generation pipeline designed to overcome the current limitation of 5-second video clips from API services. This system enables AI-powered storytelling by automating video generation with human-in-the-loop feedback, ensuring coherence, art direction, and structure while integrating LLM-powered ideation, image-to-video animation, and AI-generated music into a single seamless workflow.

This document provides a structured framework for orchestrating the development of VidsGen, offering a clear pipeline for implementation. Each step in the workflow is essential to ensuring high-quality, long-form AI-generated videos with synchronized visuals, music, and structured storytelling.

Pipeline Overview

The VidsGen pipeline is structured into distinct phases that work sequentially, with human feedback loops for refining the creative direction. Below is the full breakdown of the system:

1. User Input Query
	â€¢	The user provides an input prompt describing the desired video.
	â€¢	This serves as the seed idea for the AI system to interpret and expand upon.

2. LLM Ideation Phase (Art Direction Brainstorming)
	â€¢	A large language model (LLM) generates multiple creative interpretations based on the input query.
	â€¢	The LLM produces a structured JSON output, detailing various video concepts, themes, moods, and art directions.

3. UI Feedback: User Selects Best Art Direction
	â€¢	The JSON output is parsed and displayed in the UI.
	â€¢	The user reviews multiple proposed art directions and selects the best option.

4. LLM Generates 3 Video Script Options
	â€¢	The selected art direction brief is passed back into the LLM to generate three detailed video scripts, including:
	â€¢	Number of shots and duration per shot
	â€¢	Type of shots (close-ups, wide shots, cinematic angles)
	â€¢	Scene descriptions (characters, environments, actions)
	â€¢	Background music style and mood

5. UI Feedback: User Selects Best Script
	â€¢	The three script variations are displayed in the UI for user review.
	â€¢	The user selects the best script to proceed.

6. Generate Image Prompts for Each Shot
	â€¢	The selected script is parsed into individual scenes/shots.
	â€¢	The LLM generates a cohesive text prompt for each shot, ensuring consistency across all frames.
	â€¢	The prompts are structured in JSON format for easy extraction.

7. Generate Text Direction for Video
	â€¢	Simultaneously, the LLM generates structured text-based guidance for the video, describing:
	â€¢	How shots should transition
	â€¢	Scene timing and pacing
	â€¢	Any textual overlays, subtitles, or captions

8. Generate Background Music
	â€¢	An AI music generator is prompted based on the selected scriptâ€™s mood and style.
	â€¢	The system ensures that music is composed to fit the overall tone and pacing of the video.

9. Image-to-Video Animation Process
	â€¢	The generated image prompts are passed to a text-to-image model, which creates AI-generated images for each scene.
	â€¢	The resulting images are then fed into an image-to-video model, converting them into short animated sequences.
	â€¢	The animation process ensures smooth, cohesive visual flow between shots.

10. Combine Video, Music, and Text Direction
	â€¢	The animated video sequences, generated background music, and text overlays are synchronized into a unified video timeline.
	â€¢	AI-driven adjustments ensure that music and transitions align with the intended pacing.

11. Export & Save Final Video
	â€¢	The final long-form AI-generated video is exported in a preferred format (MP4, MOV, etc.).
	â€¢	The output is stored and ready for further editing, enhancement, or publishing.
