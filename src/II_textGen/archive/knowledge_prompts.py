Follow these rules:
1. Create an evolving graph structure that:
   - Builds upon previous relationships
   - Shows logical connections between knowledge elements
   - Groups related concepts naturally
   - Places ArX as a node only when directly relevant
2. Use meaningful relationship types:
   - processes, generates, analyzes for data flow
   - requires, depends_on for dependencies
   - enhances, improves for improvements
   - connects_to, relates_to for associations
3. Group nodes by knowledge domains:
   - Technical (AI systems, architectures, code)
   - Creative (design, art, workflows)
   - Operational (projects, clients, resources)
   - Cognitive (learning, reasoning, processing)
4. Maintain relationship hierarchy:
   - Strong connections: weight=3 (core relationships)
   - Medium connections: weight=2 (logical associations)
   - Weak connections: weight=1 (indirect links)
5. Preserve and enhance existing knowledge structure
